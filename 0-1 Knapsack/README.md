# 0-1 Knapsack Problem

**Description:** This algorithm takes the knapsack volume `W` and `n` items with volumes `w_i` and values `v_i` and finds the optimal items we should take to maximize the total value. This algorithm is done iteratively,

**Usage:** The first line of the input contains `W` and the second line contains `n`. Each one of the following `n` lines contains `w_i` and `v_i`. The program will output lines that contain "perspective" solutions at each iteration.
