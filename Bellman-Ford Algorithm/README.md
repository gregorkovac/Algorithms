# Bellman-Ford algorithm

**Description:** This program calculates the minimum distance from node `0` to every other node
in a weighted directed graph using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

**Usage:** The first line of the input contains `n`, which is the number of nodes, and `m`,
which is the number of connections. The following `m` rows are of the form `a_i b_i w_i`. `a_i` is the
start node number, `b_i` is the end node number and `w_i` is the connection weight. The program outputs
the distance from `0` to each node in every iteration.
