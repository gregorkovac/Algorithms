# Subsequence with the biggest sum

**Description:** This algorithm finds the subsequence with the biggest sum in an array of numbers using the divide and conquer method. It also prints all the steps.

**Usage:** Enter a number of numbers `N`, followed by `N` numbers. The program will output the algorithm flow in the form `[*array of numbers I'm working with*]: *biggest sum of a subsequence*`. The final sum can be seen in the last row of the output.
