# Fast Fourier Transformation

**Description:** This algorithm takes two polynomials in coefficient representation, transforms them into value representation, multiplies them and transforms the result back into coefficient representation.

**Usage:** The first line of the input is `n`, the order of the polynomials. The following two lines should represent the coefficients of the polynomials. For example:

```
1 2 3
3 0 1
```
This input represents the polynomials:
```
x^2 + 2x + 3
3x^2 + 1
```
The program will output the flow of the algorithm and the final answer in the final line.
