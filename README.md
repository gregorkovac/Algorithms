# Algorithms
## Description

This repository contains some algorithms I implemented during the course Algorithms and data structures 2 at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science (University of Ljubljana).

You can find descriptions of the individual algorithms in their folders.

**Warning:** if you are a FRI student, feel free to use the provided code to help yourself with homeworks, but don't copy it. You don't want to get into any trouble, do you? 😅

## How to run the code

0. Install Java
1. Move into the folder containing your code with <br>  `cd /path/to/folder/Algorithms/algorithm_name`
2. Compile with <br>
   `javac algorithm_name.java`
3. Run with
   `java algorithm_name`
